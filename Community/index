# Peer review community #

We're setting up a community of volunteers to help build research practice in government. We hope it could be a place where researchers can get help and advice on their research. We'd like the community to be a place people can draw on to get their research peer reviewed. 

If you're a researcher in a small agency, there may not be anyone else you can talk to about your research. We're hoping this community will help.

By 'research', we mean things like research plans, discussion guides, research ethics assessments, survey questions or behavioural experiments


# Join the community #
