#Challenges for researchers#

We’ve been doing some research on user research and usability testing. We spoke to people inside and outside of government about what user research meant to them, and what challenges they face. 

We’ve listed 15 of the challenges we heard below.


##We need your help##

We’re hoping you can help us learn:

- Which challenges you have experienced - so we can see which ones are the most common 
- Which you’d like to see solved first – which one caused the most pain
- If you have ideas, tools, resources that have helped you overcome any of these challenges in the past
