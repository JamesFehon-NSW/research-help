# Challenges for researchers #

We’ve been doing some research on user research and usability testing. We spoke to people inside and outside of government about what user research meant to them, and what challenges they face. 

We’ve listed 10 of the challenges we heard below.


## We need your help ##

We’re hoping you can help us learn:

- Which challenges you have experienced - so we can see which ones are the most common 
- Which you’d like to see solved first – which one caused the most pain
- If you have ideas, tools, resources that have helped you overcome any of these challenges in the past


## Common challenges ##

We’re using analytics on this page to track peoples movements and clicks. If you’ve experienced any of the below challenges, please click on the button underneath the challenge. 


## The biggest problem ##

Please ‘up vote’ the problem you’d like solved first. The one you think has been the biggest blocker for you in the past.

Please only vote for one! :)


## Help solve a problem for other researchers ##

If you can help solve any of the below problems, or would like to help create something that might help – please let us know. 


# Challenges #

Stakeholders don’t always understand why we need to do user research, or how its done. We spend a lot of time explaining why and how we should do it, which leaves less time to do it.

People are nervous about having conversations with people, and what they might hear. This can make them reluctant to do research.

Recruitment. Its hard to recruit the right users, or any users at all sometimes. People don't see how much work recruitment is because its usually done by a recruitment firm.

People get stuck in solution mode.

Findings of research are dismissed because it doesn’t align with stakeholder assumptions, or it identifies things that ‘can’t be fixed’

Its difficult to uncover root causes of problems, and observe real user behaviour rather than attitudes that may not reflect reality.

Time. There’s never enough time to do the research. Stakeholders often don’t understand how much time is requiredTiming. The timing of the research, and the findings is not always right. Sometimes its too late, other times its too early.

It’s a challenge to engage people with a disability due to budget, time constraints and a perception that there are a lack of penalties for inaccessible services.

Budget. Not enough money to do the research, or recruit the right people.

Presenting a lot of data in a few succinct, but system-cognizant, and applied takeaways.
