# Research community #
	

We've heard that researchers might need a place where they can get help and advice on their research. Almost like a peer review community. We've also heard annecdotally that people would like to see what research others are doing, so they can leverage the research or make use of things like discussion guides.

By 'research', we mean things like research plans, discussion guides, research ethics assessments, survey questions or behavioural experiments.


# Join the community #
	

The community doesn't exist yet. We're trying to understand if its something everyone needs, or just something a few teams would like. If you do research or usability testing in government and you're interested in joining a community of volunteers though, please [register your interest](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HWQBBL5).
