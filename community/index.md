# Peer review community #
	

We're setting up a community of volunteers to help build research practice in government. We hope it could be a place where researchers can get help and advice on their research. By 'research', we mean things like research plans, discussion guides, research ethics assessments, survey questions or behavioural experiments
	

# Join the community #
	

If you do research or usability testing in government and you're interested in joining a community of volunteers, please [register your interest](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HWQBBL5).
