# Getting consent for research

If you're doing user research or usability testing, you might need to create a consent form and participant information sheet.
In most cases, you can't do user research without these forms. 

To help make things easier for people doing research within NSW government, we've built a tool that helps build these forms quickly and easily. 


## How to use it

The tool will ask you a few questions about your research and create forms based on your answers. The questions usually take 10 minutes to complete. 

Once you answer the questions, we'll send you your forms. As this is a prototype, please allow a day or two for your forms to arrive.

## Why use it

- Compliance: the tool helps make sure your forms have all the mandatory bits under the [Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act   1998](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1998/133). 
- To save time: if you find yourself tailoring your forms based on the type of research you're conducting, the tool might save you time.   Especially if you're finding you need to get changes to forms cleared through legal and privacy teams each time you make a significant   revision. 
- For the user: the forms are also written in plain English which means its easier for research participants to read. This means they're   more likely to understand what they're agreeing to when they sign. 


## When to use it 

The first iteration of the prototype is aimed at a few research scenarios, but not all. We’re starting small and will build on it over time. 

We started with forms that can be used for research that involves:

-	adults able to provide consent on their own behalf 
-	non-sensitive topics
-	publication of anonymised research findings

Sensitive research topics (for example, domestic violence or health matters) are a bit more complicated. The same goes for gaining consent from children. If you plan to publish or share findings that are not anonymised, you'll also need additional levels of consent. We plan to look at more scenarios in future. 

If you want to use the consent form tool for these kinds of projects, you may need to work with your legal team to add a few extra clauses. 

The tool only complies with the [Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1998/133). If you're doing research outside NSW, you might need to add different levels of consent too.

## Check in with legal and privacy 

The individual parts in the forms have been reviewed by privacy and legal experts in our organisation. However, we encourage you to check in with your own legal and privacy teams. 

Your organisation might have different needs that aren’t addressed by our form yet. This is especially true if you're not doing research in NSW, every jurisdiction has different privacy laws.

You can also forward our details to your legal and privacy teams if they’d like to be involved in helping us improve our forms. 

## Get involved 

If you would like to work with us on this project, please get in touch! We’re also looking for people who can help us test the forms with more citizens and build out the clauses for different research scenarios.
