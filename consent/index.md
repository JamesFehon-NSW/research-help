# Getting consent in research

If you’re new to research or service design, or your organisation is, you might need to create a consent form and participant information sheet. 

We've built a tool that helps you build these forms quickly and easily. It also helps make sure your forms have all the mandatory bits.

The tool will ask you a few questions about your research and then you'll get a form emailed to you. It usually takes 10-15 minutes to complete.

## When to use it 

The first iteration of the prototype is aimed at a few research scenarios, but not all. We’re starting small and will build on it over time. 

We started with forms that can be used for research that involves:

-	adults able to provide consent on their own behalf 
-	non-sensitive topics
-	publication of anonymised research findings

Sensitive research topics (for example, domestic violence or health matters) are a bit more complicated. The same goes for gaining consent from children. If you plan to publish or share findings that are not anonymised, you'll need additional levels of consent. We plan to look at these scenarios in future. 

If you want to use the consent form tool for these kinds of projects, you may need to work with your legal team to add a few extra clauses. 

## Check in with legal and privacy 

The individual parts in the forms have been reviewed by privacy and legal experts in our organisation. However, we encourage you to check in with your own legal and privacy teams. Your organisation might have different needs that aren’t addressed by our form yet. This is especially true if you're not doing research in NSW. Every jurisdiction has different privacy laws, so if you're from outside NSW you might need to add extra terms.

You can also forward our details to your legal and privacy teams if they’d like to be involved in helping us improve our forms. 

## Get involved 

If you would like to work with us on this project, please get in touch! We’re also looking for people who can help us test the forms with more citizens and build out the clauses for different research scenarios. We can be contacted at: digital@finance.nsw.gov.au.
