# Sharing research #

Sharing research across government helps reduce the cost of research, and increase its impact. In most cases we'll still have to do our own research, but it can save us lots of time. If you have research you would like to share or publish, we have a handy tool that helps you check what you need to do to share or publish it. 

The tool asks a few questions about how the research was done, and who owns it. It takes around 10 minutes to complete. Once you've filled it out, we'll let you know what you need to do!
