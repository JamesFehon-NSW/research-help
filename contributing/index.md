# Sharing research #

Sharing research across government helps reduce the cost of research, and increase its impact. In most cases researchers will still need to do their own research, but it can save a lot of time.

If you have research you would like to share or publish, we have a handy tool that can help. 

The tool will ask you a few questions about how the research was done and who owns it. The questions will take around 10 minutes to complete. 

Once you've answered the questions, we'll let you know what you need to do to publish or share the research! As this is a prototype, you won't get an answer straight away. We'll usually touch base with you within 2 days.
