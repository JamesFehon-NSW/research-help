    Weâ€™ve been doing some research with people who do user research and usability testing inside and outside government. During the research we heard about pain points user researchers and services designers face. 
    
    We heard that recruiting users was a challenge, especially for small teams with limited budget. Recruiting users from a diverse background was particularly challenging. 
    
    We observed that getting consent forms setup was time consuming and sometimes confusing. 

    We heard that people often want someone to help them design their research. Or they might want someone to do a sense check on their research questions. However, they don't always have people inside their organisation that can help. 
    
    We've made this prototype to test out some ideas, to see if we can help with some of these challenges. 
    
    This is a prototype so what you see here will change as we test and learn. Have a look around and tell us what you think.
