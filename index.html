    <h1>Getting help with research</h1>

    <p>We’ve been doing some research with people who do user research and usability testing inside and outside government. During the research we heard about pain points that user researchers and services designers face.</p>
    
    
    <h2>User research in government is tricky</h2>

    <p>There are a lot of things that make it hard to do research in government. Not everyone understands why we should do user research or how it’s done. The amount of work involved, and the budget needed aren’t always well understood either. It’s hard to recruit the right users, and it’s hard to share and reuse research.</p> 

    <p>This prototype is a way for us to learn more about these challenges. Its also a way for us to test if we can help in any way. As this is a prototype, what you see here will change as we test and learn.</p>
