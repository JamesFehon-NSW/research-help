    <h1>Getting help with research</h1>

    <p>Weâ€™ve been doing some research with people who do user research and usability testing inside and outside government. During the research we heard about pain points user researchers and services designers face.</p>
    
    <p>We've made this prototype to test out some ideas, to see if we can help with some of these challenges we heard about.</p>
    
    <h2>Challenges in research</h2>

    <p>During our research we heard that recruiting users was a challenge, especially for small teams with limited budget. Recruiting users from a diverse background was particularly challenging.</p>
    
    <p>We observed that getting consent forms setup was time consuming and sometimes confusing.</p> 

    <p>We also heard that people often want someone to help them design their research. Or they might want someone to do a sense check on their research questions. However, they don't always have people inside their organisation that can help.</p> 

    <p>This prototype is a way for us to learn more about these challenges. Its also a way for us to test if we can help in any way. As this is a prototype, what you see here will change as we test and learn.</p>
