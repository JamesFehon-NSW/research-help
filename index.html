    <h1>Research on research</h1>

    <p>Weâ€™ve been doing some research with people who do user research and usability testing inside and outside government. During the research we heard about challenges that user researchers and services designers face.</p>
    
    <p>One of the challenges we observed was that consent forms and participant information sheets can be a hurdle for some teams. Creating these forms can be a time-consuming and sometimes confusing process.</p>

    <p>This prototype is a way for us to test if we can help with these challenges. As this is a prototype, what you see here will change as we test and learn.</p>
