## Takedown Position Statement ##
Digital.nsw is committed to enhancing the public availability, sharing and exchange of information. These objectives are in line with the [NSW Government Open Data Policy](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/policy/data-information/making-data-open/nsw-open-data-policy) which encourages NSW Government agencies to release and use data to improve policies and programs for the community.  

When deciding to publish material online, Digital.nsw has made the best effort to ensure that it has all relevant licences and consents to publish copyright material and sensitive personal or cultural information  and ensure that such material is appropriately protected and balancing this with rights of access to information held in the user research repository. Despite these efforts, there may be occasions when material made available online is considered to breach copyright or other relevant law or crosses boundaries of cultural sensitivity. 

In order to maintain a consistent approach to takedown requests, Digital.nsw have agreed to take into consideration the following general principles: 

A written request with reasons and relevant evidence from a requestor will be the instigation for determining whether content needs to be taken down from the website 

Permanent access restrictions or takedown will be considered as an exceptional response 

Relationship of the requestor to the relevant material or impact on the requestor 

Content of the material (including the sensitivity of personal information, offensive nature, or culture sensitivity and ownership of copyright) 

Specific jurisdictional legislation and related exemptions 

Access restrictions or takedown of material made available online should, as far as practical, be openly acknowledged with a statement noting the takedown 

As circumstances change, or after a period of time, material that has been restricted access, taken down or redacted will be reviewed and reinstated 

### Procedure for making a take-down request ###

If you are concerned about specific material we have published online and would like us to review its online accessibility or copyright attribution, please contact us in writing with the following: 

- Your contact details 
- Full description and details of the material (including the URL where you found the material) 
- The reason for your requests, including (but not limited to) copyright law, privacy laws, data protection, defamation or proof of your rights to the material, etc 
- The potential impact should it continue to be discoverable online 

### Possible outcomes in response to takedown requests  ###

- Access to the material remains unchanged on the Digital Design System (DDS) repository and website 
- Access to the material is restored via the DDS repository 
- Access to the material is restored with changes in response to the takedown request via the DDS repository and website 
- Access to the material is modified or redacted 
- Material is retained in the DDS collection but access is removed 
- Material is removed from the DDS website and/or collection 

We should also state that there will be regular reviews of take-down decisions and that where the circumstances of the original take-down request have changed over time, it may result in access to the material being restored.
