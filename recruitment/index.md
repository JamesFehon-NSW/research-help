# Research recruitment

Recruiting the right users for user research can be hard, costly, and time consuming. We think a research recruitment service that's open to people doing research in government might make researchers lives easier. 

Before we open it up for use though, we need a lots of people to sign up. If we don't have enough people on the list, we'll all just end up interviewing the same people! We're a really small team though so we can't build the list without your help.

## Get involved

Anything you can do to promote the service will help. You could promote it on your social media accounts, or on your website. If you've done the hard work to recruit users for a usability test or an interview, we've got flyers you can share with them if they want to do further research.

## Build the service kit

To help make promoting the service easier, we've made a kit you might be able to use.  

The kit includes templates for:

- Tweets
- Facebook posts
- A flyer
- An email invitation
- A mission patch sticker
