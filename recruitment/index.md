# Research recruitment

Recruiting the right users for user research can be hard, costly, and time consuming. We think a research recruitment service that's open to people doing research in government might help. 

Before we open it up for researchers to use though, we need a lots of users to sign up. If we don't have enough people on the list, everyone will end up interviewing the same people. We're a really small team though, so we can't build the list without your help!

## Get involved

Anything you can do to promote the recruitment service will help. You could promote it on your social media accounts, or on your website. If you've done the hard work to recruit users for a usability test or an interview, we've also got flyers you can share with them if they want to do further research.

To help make promoting the service easier, we've made a kit you might be able to use. The kit includes templates for:

- Tweets
- Facebook posts
- Website content
- A flyer
- An email invitation for participants
