# Research recruitment

Recruiting the right users for user research can be hard, costly, and time consuming. We think a research recruitment service that's open to government researchers might help. 

We're in the process of building the recruitment list, so it might be a while before the service goes live. If you'd like to use the recruitment service once it goes live, you can [register your interest](https://forms.gle/UFhcuZURNnW6KCjB7). 


We can't open the list up to researchers until we have enough research particpants signed up. If we don't have enough people on the list researchers will just end up talking to the same people. 


## We need your help

We're a really small team, so we need help building the list of research participants. If you can help promote the service so more people sign up, it will help us deliver something sooner. 

## How to promote the service

You could promote it on your social media accounts, or on your organisation's website. If you've done the hard work to recruit users for a usability test or an interview, we've also got flyers you can share with them to encourage them to sign up for future research.

To make promoting the service easier, we've made a kit you can use to promote the service. The kit includes templates for:

- Tweets
- Facebook posts
- Website content
- A flyer
- An email invitation for participants
