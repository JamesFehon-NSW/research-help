# Research recruitment

Recruiting the right users for user research can be hard, costly, and time consuming. We think a research recruitment service that's open to people doing research in government might help. We're in the process of building a list of users willing to participate in user research. We can't open the service for researchers to use until we've got enough user research participants signed up though. Otherwise researchers will just end up talking to the same users!

If you'd like to use the recruitment service once it goes live, you can [register your interest](https://forms.gle/UFhcuZURNnW6KCjB7). 

## Get involved

We're a really small team though, so we can't build the list without your help! Anything you can do to promote the recruitment service will help. 

You could promote it on your social media accounts, or on your website. If you've done the hard work to recruit users for a usability test or an interview, we've also got flyers you can share with them if they want to do further research.

To help make promoting the service easier, we've made a kit you might be able to use. The kit includes templates for:

- Tweets
- Facebook posts
- Website content
- A flyer
- An email invitation for participants
