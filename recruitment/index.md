# Research recruitment

Recruiting the right users for user research can be hard, costly, and time consuming. Small teams often have to use social media to recruit users, or through community networks. This can take a lot of time, and teams might not get to speak to the right people. Some teams have a budget to use a private user research recruitment service, but for some teams the cost of recruitment is a barrier to doing research. 

We think a research recruitment service that's open to government researchers might help. 

We're still testing if there is a need for this service, so it might be a while before it goes live. If we find there isn't a need for it, it won't go live at all. 

If you'd be interested in using a research recruitment service to recruit user research participants, you can [register your interest](https://forms.gle/UFhcuZURNnW6KCjB7). 


## We need your help

If we find there is a need for a research recruitment service, we'll need your help creating and promoting the service. We're a really small team, so we can't do it without your help. 

If you can help in any way, please get in touch.
