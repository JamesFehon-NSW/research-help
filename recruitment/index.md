# Research recruitment

Recruiting the right users for user research can be hard, costly, and time consuming. We think a research recruitment service that's open to government researchers might help. 

If you'd like to use the recruitment service once it goes live, you can [register your interest](https://forms.gle/UFhcuZURNnW6KCjB7). 

We're in the process of signing up people who might like to participate in research to the service. We can't open the list up to researchers until we have enough participants on the list. Otherwise researchers will just end up talking to the same people!


## We need your help

We're a really small team, so we need help building the list of research participants. If you can help promote the service, it will help us deliver something researchers can use sooner. 

You could promote it on your social media accounts, or on your website. If you've done the hard work to recruit users for a usability test or an interview, we've also got flyers you can share with them to encourage them to sign up for future research.

To make promoting the service easier, we've made a kit you might be able to use. The kit includes templates for:

- Tweets
- Facebook posts
- Website content
- A flyer
- An email invitation for participants
