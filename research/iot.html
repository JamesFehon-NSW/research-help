<H2>Internet of Things framework insights</h2>
            
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) project is addressing recommendation 31 from the State Infrastructure Strategy 2018-2038: Lead the development of a whole of government policy framework to guide investment in IoT and connected infrastructure to maximise the benefits and manage the potential risks of connected infrastructure.</p>
<p>This work aims to realise the potential applications of IoT across NSW, to improve infrastructure life and maintenance and provide benefits for the community. An IoT policy framework and smart infrastructure policy will help to make better informed investment decisions. The project is being let by the Office of the Secretary (OSec), and the Policy Lab is working with the OSec to ensure the Framework meets the needs of the user through following a human-centred design approach.</p>
<p>The IoT project started in February, kicking-off with a Hopes and Fears workshop attended by key IoT stakeholders and subject matter experts in the NSW Government, local government, academia and industry. This was followed by 34 in-depth stakeholder interviews to determine what the Framework needs to include and address.  From these interviews, the team drew 10 key insights about the use of IoT in the NSW state and local governments.</p>
                    
<h3>Insights</h3>
<p><strong>I use connected devices in my projects, but I don’t consider it Internet of Things (IoT).&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I don’t use IoT, but I use technology to improve my work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If I’m not clear about the outcomes I want to achieve then how can I know if IoT devices will help and how?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been told to use&nbsp;IoT&nbsp;but I don’t know why.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IoT isn’t always the answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I have sensors in place, but it doesn’t mean I have the solution. IoT is an enabling technology, it’s what you do with it that counts.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I can collect all the data in the world, but it’s useless if I don’t own it, use it or if I don’t have the ability to make any changes based on what I learn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know how to use it but how can I take full advantage of IoT?&nbsp;</p>

<p>IoT is not always deliberate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There is no one size fits all approach to IoT&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Standards, maturity, capability, capacity and application of IoT are different across users and potential users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am&nbsp;regional&nbsp;and my capacity is different to my&nbsp;colleagues is metropolitan NSW. How can I make the best from what I have?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I hope this framework will support my decisions and enable me to try IoT&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I can work out how much my IoT project will cost but it's hard to demonstrate the non-financial benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its challenging to communicate the value of IoT past the immediate needs – I don’t know how to make the case for the long-term and indirect benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don’t know what all the risks&nbsp;are&nbsp;but I know that they are there and that’s stopping me from trying IoT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope that following the IoT framework will lessen the risks for me in trying new IoT projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The success of my project depends on the decision makers, enablers and users knowing what IoT is, how to use it and why it is important&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I understand there is good work being done with IoT, but I don’t know what it is or how to find it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I want to be told what to do but I also want flexibility&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I need flexibility to suit my&nbsp;circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also need step-by-step instructions because I don’t&nbsp;know where to start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need guidance to make flexible decisions to allow for technology changes – I want to future-proof&nbsp;my&nbsp;decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I don’t understand the data and privacy risks, so I don’t try&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I want to use the best solution available,&nbsp;but I know there are privacy and data risks that I don’t understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My data is sensitive&nbsp;so I’m not comfortable collecting it with sensors or sharing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I’m excited about using IoT but I’m scared of buying the wrong thing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My project&nbsp;had&nbsp;months of trial and error because the market is so new,&nbsp;and suppliers and products are&nbsp;untested and often unreliable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IoT isn’t easy to categorise for procurement purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I installed sensors in my parking&nbsp;garage&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;can’t access or share the data because the vendor owns it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I want the framework to help government, academia and industry to develop shared solutions&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I want to understand how the IoT framework fits with other&nbsp;NSW government priorities and strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I want this framework to align with other jurisdictions to prevent conflicts in standards and requirements. It should adopt domestic or&nbsp;international standards where possible.&nbsp;</p>
